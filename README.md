## Goal

Our goal for this project was to develop problem solving skills in a team environment. Furthermore, in this project we employed the software development lifecycle and gained hands-on experience with the agile design process.

## How to run

Player vs Player game:
```bash 
make game
game.exe
```

Player vs Computer game:
```bash 
make aigame
aigame.exe

## The game

There is a 3x3 grid of goal posts with a max of 3 balls in each post...
Goal is to get 4, 3 in a rows...

## How to play

When prompted you can `add` or `remove` a ball from the board by specifying the post number. A mmini board will be displayed with the post numbers.

Add a ball to the board:
